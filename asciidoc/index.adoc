This is a draft version of the new documentation for http://www.rapidoid.org[Rapidoid].

Things to improve in the docs:

- the important concepts (architecture, design etc.) should be explained in more details,
- the examples should be organized by categories,
- information about the HTTP routes and sample requests/responses should be included for each example.
